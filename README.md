### Overview:
If you have face a database with so many features that while working it gets messy, a good idea is to select some of these features for your model. However, this is not a trivial question, and to help you with this task, we have created the `feature-selection` package in **python**.

### Feature description:
In this package, four functions are included to lead with feature selection:

#### Forward
- TO DESCRIBE

#### Backward
- TO DESCRIBE

#### Variance Thresholding  
- TO DESCRIBE

#### Simulated Annealing  
- TO DESCRIBE

### Installation:

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ feature-selection
```
